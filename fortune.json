But knowledge alone is not\nsufficient for some applications; wisdom is needed as well.

As a test of our ideas, we have written IMMANUEL, a\nwisdom based system for the task domain of western philosophical thought.\nIMMANUEL was supplied initially with 200 wisdom units which contained wisdom\nabout such elementary concepts as mind, matter, being, nothingness, and so\nforth.  IMMANUEL was then allowed to run freely, guided by the heuristic\nrules contained in its heterarchically organized meta wisdom base.  IMMANUEL\nsucceeded in rediscovering most of the important philosophical ideas developed\nin western culture over the course of the last 25 centuries, including those\nunderlying Plato's theory of government, Kant's metaphysics, Nietzsche's theory\nof value, and Husserl's phenomenology.

This language, developed at the Hanover College for\nTechnological Misfits, was designed to make it impossible to write code\nwith errors in it.  The statements are, therefore, confined to BEGIN,\nEND and STOP.  No matter how you arrange the statements, you can't make\na syntax error.  Programs written in SIMPLE do nothing useful.  Thus\nthey achieve the results of programs written in other languages without\nthe tedious, frustrating process of testing and debugging.","\tTHE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #12: LITHP\n\nThis otherwise unremarkable language is distinguished by the absence of\nan \"S\" in its character set; users must substitute \"TH\".  LITHP is said\nto be useful in protheththing lithtth.","\tTHE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #13: SLOBOL\n\nSLOBOL is best known for the speed, or lack of it, of its compiler.\nAlthough many compilers allow you to take a coffee break while they\ncompile, SLOBOL compilers allow you to travel to Bolivia to pick the\ncoffee.  Forty-three programmers are known to have died of boredom\nsitting at their terminals while waiting for a SLOBOL program to\ncompile.  Weary SLOBOL programmers often turn to a related (but\ninfinitely faster) language, COCAINE.","\tTHE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #14 -- VALGOL\n\n\tVALGOL is enjoying a dramatic surge of popularity across the\nindustry.  VALGOL commands include REALLY, LIKE, WELL, and Y*KNOW.\nVariables are assigned with the =LIKE and =TOTALLY operators.  Other\noperators include the \"California booleans\", AX and NOWAY.  Loops are\naccomplished with the FOR SURE construct.  A simple example:\n\n\tLIKE, Y*KNOW(I MEAN)START\n\tIF PIZZA\t=LIKE BITCHEN AND\n\tGUY\t\t=LIKE TUBULAR AND\n\tVALLEY GIRL\t=LIKE GRODY**MAX(FERSURE)**2\n\tTHEN\n\t\tFOR I =LIKE 1 TO OH*MAYBE 100\n\t\t\tDO*WAH - (DITTY**2); BARF(I)=TOTALLY GROSS(OUT)\n\t\tSURE\n\tLIKE, BAG THIS PROGRAM; REALLY; LIKE TOTALLY(Y*KNOW); IM*SURE\n\tGOTO THE MALL\n\n\tVALGOL is also characterized by its unfriendly error messages.  For\nexample, when the user makes a syntax error, the interpreter displays the\nmessage GAG ME WITH A SPOON!  A successful compile may be termed MAXIMALLY\nAWESOME!","\tTHE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #15 -- DOGO\n\n\tDeveloped at the Massachusetts Institute of Obedience Training, DOGO\nDOGO heralds a new era of computer-literate pets.

An innovative feature of DOGO is \"puppy\ngraphics\", a small cocker spaniel that occasionally leaves a deposit as\nit travels across the screen.","\tTHE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #16: C-\n\nThis language was named for the grade received by its creator when he\nsubmitted it as a class project in a graduate programming class.  C- is best\ndescribed as a \"low-level\" programming language.  In fact, the language\ngenerally requires more C- statements than machine-code statements to\nexecute a given task.  In this respect, it is very similar to COBOL.","\tTHE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #17: SARTRE\n\nNamed after the late existential philosopher, SARTRE is an extremely\nunstructured language.  Statements in SARTRE have no purpose; they just are.\nThus SARTRE programs are left to define their own functions. SARTRE\nprogrammers tend to be boring and depressed, and are no fun at parties.","\tTHE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #18: FIFTH\n\nFIFTH is a precision mathematical language in which the data types\nrefer to quantity.  The data types range from CC, OUNCE, SHOT, and\nJIGGER to FIFTH (hence the name of the language), LITER, MAGNUM and\nBLOTTO.  Commands refer to ingredients such as CHABLIS, CHARDONNAY,\nCABERNET, GIN, VERMOUTH, VODKA, SCOTCH, and WHATEVERSAROUND.\n\nThe many versions of the FIFTH language reflect the sophistication and\nfinancial status of its users.  Commands in the ELITE dialect include\nVSOP and LAFITE, while commands in the GUTTER dialect include HOOTCH\nand RIPPLE. The latter is a favorite of frustrated FORTH programmers\nwho end up using this language.","\tTHE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #2: RENE\n\nNamed after the famous French philosopher and mathematician Rene DesCartes,\nRENE is a language used for artificial intelligence.  The language is being\ndeveloped at the Chicago Center of Machine Politics and Programming under a\ngrant from the Jane Byrne Victory Fund.  A spokesman described the language\nas \"Just as great as dis [sic] city of ours.\"\n\nThe center is very pleased with progress to date.  They say they have almost\nsucceeded in getting a VAX to think. However, sources inside the\norganization say that each time the machine fails to think it ceases to exist.","\tTHE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #8: LAIDBACK\n\nThis language was developed at the Marin County Center for T'ai Chi,\nMellowness and Computer Programming (now defunct), as an alternative to\nthe more intense atmosphere in nearby Silicon Valley.\n\nThe center was ideal for programmers who liked to soak in hot tubs while\nthey worked.  Unfortunately few programmers could survive there because the\ncenter outlawed Pizza and Coca-Cola in favor of Tofu and Perrier.\n\nMany mourn the demise of LAIDBACK because of its reputation as a gentle and\nnon-threatening language since all error messages are in lower case.  For\nexample, LAIDBACK responded to syntax errors with the message:\n\n\t\"i hate to bother you, but i just can't relate to that.  can\n\tyou find the time to try it again?\"","The Macintosh is Xerox technology at its best.","\tThe Magician of the Ivory Tower brought his latest invention for the\nmaster programmer to examine.

In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers of religion\nmust have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God, that is,\ngive up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vast\npowers in the hands of priests.  In their labors they will have to avail\nthemselves of those forces which are capable of cultivating the Good, the\nTrue, and the Beautiful in humanity itself.

All proffered\nsamples of learning must go to the same assay-room and be subjected to\ncommon tests.  It is the essence of all dogmatic faiths to hold that\nany such \"show-down\" is sacrilegious and perverse.

Pull one of these\n\thorses out of the set, so that you have k horses.  Suppose that all\n\tof these horses are the same color.  Now put back the horse that you\n\ttook out, and pull out a different one.  Suppose that all of the k\n\thorses now in the set are the same color.  Then the set of k+1 horses\n\tare all the same color.  We have k true => k+1 true; therefore all\n\thorses are the same color.\nTheorem: All horses have an infinite number of legs.\nProof (by intimidation):\n\tEveryone would agree that all horses have an even number of legs.  It\n\tis also well-known that horses have forelegs in front and two legs in\n\tback.  4 + 2 = 6 legs, which is certainly an odd number of legs for a\n\thorse to have!  Now the only number that is both even and odd is\n\tinfinity; therefore all horses have an infinite number of legs.\n\tHowever, suppose that there is a horse somewhere that does not have an\n\tinfinite number of legs.  Well, that would be a horse of a different\n\tcolor; and by the Lemma, it doesn't exist.","leverage, n.:\n\tEven if someone doesn't care what the world thinks\n\tabout them, they always hope their mother doesn't find out.","Lewis's Law of Travel:\n\tThe first piece of luggage out of the chute doesn't belong to anyone,\n\tever.","Liar, n.:\n\tA lawyer with a roving commission.\n\t\t-- Ambrose Bierce, \"The Devil's Dictionary\"","Liar:\n\tone who tells an unpleasant truth.\n\t\t-- Oliver Herford","Lie, n.:\n\tA very poor substitute for the truth, but the only one\n\tdiscovered to date.","Lieberman's Law:\n\tEverybody lies, but it doesn't matter since nobody listens.","life, n.:\n\tA whim of several billion cells to be you for a while.","life, n.:\n\tLearning about people the hard way -- by being one.","life, n.:\n\tThat brief interlude between nothingness and eternity.","lighthouse, n.:\n\tA tall building on the seashore in which the government\n\tmaintains a lamp and the friend of a politician.","like:\n\tWhen being alive at the same time is a wonderful coincidence.","Linus' Law:\n\tThere is no heavier burden than a great potential.","lisp, v.:\n\tTo call a spade a thpade.","Lockwood's Long Shot:\n\tThe chances of getting eaten up by a lion on Main Street\n\taren't one in a million, but once would be enough.","love,  n.:\n\tLove ties in a knot in the end of the rope.","love, n.:\n\tWhen it's growing, you don't mind watering it with a few tears.","love, n.:\n\tWhen you don't want someone too close--because you're very sensitive\n\tto pleasure.","love, n.:\n\tWhen you like to think of someone on days that begin with a morning.","love, n.:\n\tWhen, if asked to choose between your lover\n\tand happiness, you'd skip happiness in a heartbeat.","love, v.:\n\tI'll let you play with my life if you'll let me play with yours.","Lowery's Law:\n\tIf it jams -- force it.

Place pronouns as close as possible, especially in long\nsentences, as of 10 or more words, to their antecedents.  Writing carefully,\ndangling participles must be avoided.  If any word is improper at the end of\na sentence, a linking verb is.  Take the bull by the hand and avoid mixing\nmetaphors.  Avoid trendy locutions that sound flaky.  Everyone should be\ncareful to use a singular pronoun with singular nouns in their writing.\nAlways pick on the correct idiom.  The adverb always follows the verb.

Upon our arrival we immediately set up a rigorous schedule:  Up at\n6:00, breakfast, and back in bed by 7:00.  Pretty soon we were back in bed by\n6:30.  Now Africa is full of big game.  The first day I shot two bucks.  That\nwas the biggest game we had.  Africa is primerally inhabited by Elks, Moose\nand Knights of Pithiests.\n\tThe elks live up in the mountains and come down once a year for their\nannual conventions.  And you should see them gathered around the water hole,\nwhich they leave immediately when they discover it's full of water.  They\nweren't looking for a water hole.  They were looking for an alck hole.\n\tOne morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas, how he got in my\npajamas, I don't know.  Then we tried to remove the tusks.  That's a tough\nword to say, tusks.  As I said we tried to remove the tusks, but they were\nimbedded so firmly we couldn't get them out.  But in Alabama the Tuscaloosa,\nbut that is totally irrelephant to what I was saying.\n\tWe took some pictures of the native girls, but they weren't developed.\nSo we're going back in a few years...\n\t\t-- Julius H.

abstracted from sequence.\nThe sage experiences without abstraction,\nAnd accomplishes without action;\nHe accepts the ebb and flow of things,\nNurtures them, but does not own them,\nAnd lives, but does not dwell.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Without Action\n\nNot praising the worthy prevents contention,\nNot esteeming the valuable prevents theft,\nNot displaying the beautiful prevents desire.\nIn this manner the sage governs people:\nEmptying their minds,\nFilling their bellies,\nWeakening their ambitions,\nAnd strengthening their bones.\nIf people lack knowledge and desire\nThen

not kind;\nIt treats all things impartially.\nThe Sage is not kind,\nAnd treats all people impartially.\nNature is like a bellows,\nEmpty, yet never ceasing its supply.\nThe more it moves, the more it

is like water,\nWhich benefits all things, and does not contend with them,\nWhich flows in places that others disdain,\nWhere it is in harmony with the Way.\nSo the sage:\nLives within nature,\nThinks within the deep,\nGives within impartiality,\nSpeaks within trust,\nGoverns within order,\nCrafts within ability,\nActs within opportunity.\nHe does not contend, and none contend against him.\n\t\t--

come from what exists,\nBut use from what does not.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Substance\n\nToo much colour blinds the eye,\nToo much music deafens the ear,\nToo much taste dulls the palate,\nToo much play maddens the mind,\nToo much desire tears the heart.\nIn this manner the sage cares for people:\nHe provides for the belly, not for the senses;\nHe ignores abstraction and holds fast to substance.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Self\n\nBoth praise and blame cause concern,\nFor they bring people hope and fear.\nThe object of hope and fear is the self -\nFor, without self, to whom may fortune and disaster occur?\nTherefore,\nWho distinguishes himself from the world may be given the world,\nBut who regards himself as the world may accept the world.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Mystery\n\nLooked at but cannot be seen - it is beneath form;\nListened to but cannot be heard - it is beneath sound;\nHeld but cannot be touched - it is beneath feeling;\nThese depthless things evade definition,\nAnd blend into a single mystery.\nIn its rising there is no light,\nIn its falling there is no darkness,\nA continuous thread beyond description,\nLining what does not exist;\nIts form formless,\nIts image nothing,\nIts name silence;\nFollow it, it has no back,\nMeet it, it has no face.\nAttend the present to deal with the past;\nThus you grasp the continuity of the Way,\nWhich is its essence.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Enlightenment\n\nThe enlightened possess understanding\nSo profound they can not be understood.\nBecause they cannot be understood\nI can only describe their appearance:\nCautious as one crossing thin ice,\nUndecided as one surrounded by danger,\nModest as one who is a guest,\nUnbounded as melting ice,\nGenuine as unshaped wood,\nBroad as a valley,\nSeamless as muddy water.\nWho stills the water that the mud may settle,\nWho seeks to stop that he may travel on,\nWho desires less than what may transpire,\nDecays, but will not renew.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Decay and Renewal\n\nEmpty the self completely;\nEmbrace perfect peace.\nThe world will rise and move;\nWatch it return to rest.\nAll the flourishing things\nWill return to their source.\nThis return is peaceful;\nIt is the flow of nature,\nAn eternal decay and renewal.\nAccepting this brings enlightenment,\nIgnoring this brings misery.\nWho accepts nature's flow becomes all-cherishing;\nBeing all-cherishing he becomes impartial;\nBeing impartial he becomes magnanimous;\nBeing magnanimous he becomes natural;\nBeing natural he becomes one with the Way;\nBeing one with the Way he becomes immortal:\nThough his body will decay, the Way will not.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Rulers\n\nThe best rulers are scarcely known by their subjects;\nThe next best are loved and praised;\nThe next are feared;\nThe next despised:\nThey have no faith in their people,\nAnd their people become unfaithful to them.\nWhen the best rulers achieve their purpose\nTheir subjects claim the achievement as their own.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Hypocrisy\n\nWhen the Way is forgotten\nDuty and justice appear;\nThen knowledge and wisdom are born\nAlong with hypocrisy.\nWhen harmonious relationships dissolve\nThen respect and devotion arise;\nWhen a nation falls to chaos\nThen loyalty and patriotism are born.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Simplify\n\nIf we could discard knowledge and wisdom\nThen people would profit a hundredfold;\nIf we could discard duty and justice\nThen harmonious relationships would form;\nIf we could discard artifice and profit\nThen waste and theft would disappear.\nYet such remedies treat only symptoms\nAnd so they are inadequate.\nPeople need personal remedies:\nReveal your naked self and embrace your original nature;\nBind your self-interest and control your ambition;\nForget your habits and simplify your affairs.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Wandering\n\nWhat is the difference between assent and denial?\nWhat is the difference between beautiful and ugly?\nWhat is the difference between fearsome and afraid?\nThe people are merry as if at a magnificent party\nOr playing in the park at springtime,\nBut I am tranquil and wandering,\nLike a newborn before it learns to smile,\nAlone, with no true home.\nThe people have enough and to spare,\nWhere I have nothing,\nAnd my heart is foolish,\nMuddled and cloudy.\nThe people are bright and certain,\nWhere I am dim and confused;\nThe people are clever and wise,\nWhere I am dull and ignorant;\nAimless as a wave drifting over the sea,\nAttached to nothing.\nThe people are busy with purpose,\nWhere I am impractical and rough;\nI do not share the peoples' cares\nBut I am fed at nature's breast.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Accept\n\nHarmony is only in following the Way.\nThe Way is without form or quality,\nBut expresses all forms and qualities;\nThe Way is hidden and implicate,\nBut expresses all of nature;\nThe Way is unchanging,\nBut expresses all motion.\nBeneath sensation and memory\nThe Way is the source of all the world.\nHow can I understand the source of the world?\nBy accepting.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Home\n\nAccept and you become whole,\nBend and you straighten,\nEmpty and you fill,\nDecay and you renew,\nWant and you acquire,\nFulfill and you become confused.\nThe sage accepts the world\nAs the world accepts the Way;\nHe does not display himself, so is clearly seen,\nDoes not justify himself, so is recognized,\nDoes not boast, so is credited,\nDoes not pride himself, so endures,\nDoes not contend, so none contend against him.\nThe ancients said, \"Accept and you become whole\",\nOnce whole, the world is as your home.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Words\n\nNature says only a few words:\nHigh wind does not last long,\nNor does heavy rain.\nIf nature's words do not last\nWhy should those of man?\nWho accepts harmony, becomes harmonious.\nWho accepts loss, becomes lost.\nFor who accepts harmony, the Way harmonizes with him,\nAnd who accepts loss, the Way cannot find.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Indulgence\n\nStraighten yourself and you will not stand steady;\nDisplay yourself and you will not be clearly seen;\nJustify yourself and you will not be respected;\nPromote yourself and you will not be believed;\nPride yourself and you will not endure.\nThese behaviours are wasteful, indulgent,\nAnd so they attract disfavour;\nHarmony avoids them.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Beneath Abstraction\n\nThere is a mystery,\nBeneath abstraction,\nSilent, depthless,\nAlone, unchanging,\nUbiquitous and liquid,\nThe mother of nature.\nIt has no name, but I call it \"the Way\";\nIt has no limit, but I call it \"limitless\".\nBeing limitless, it flows away forever;\nFlowing away forever, it returns to my self:\nThe Way is limitless,\nSo nature is limitless,\nSo the world is limitless,\nAnd so I am limitless.\nFor I am abstracted from the world,\nThe world from nature,\nNature from the Way,\nAnd the Way from what is beneath abstraction.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Calm\n\nGravity is the source of lightness,\nCalm, the master of haste.\nA lone traveller will journey all day, watching over his\nbelongings;\nOnly safe in his own bed may he lose them in sleep.\nSo the captain of a great vessel should not act lightly or hastily.\nActing lightly, he loses sight of the world,\nActing hastily, he loses control of himself.\nThe captain can not treat his great ship as a small boat;\nRather than glitter like jade\nHe must stand like stone.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Perfection\n\nThe perfect traveller leaves no trail to be followed;\nThe perfect speaker leaves no question to be answered;\nThe perfect accountant leaves no working to be completed;\nThe perfect container leaves no lock to be closed;\nThe perfect knot leaves no end to be ravelled.\nSo the sage nurtures all men\nAnd abandons no one.\nHe accepts everything\nAnd rejects nothing.\nHe attends to the smallest details.\nFor the strong must guide the weak;\nThe weak are raw material to the strong.\nIf the guide is not respected,\nOr the material is not cared for,\nConfusion will result, no matter how clever one is.\nThis is the secret of perfection:\nWhen raw wood is carved, it becomes a tool;\nWhen a man is employed, he becomes a tool;\nThe perfect carpenter leaves no wood to be carved.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Becoming\n\nUsing the male, being female,\nBeing the entrance of the world,\nYou embrace harmony\nAnd become as a newborn.\nUsing strength, being weak,\nBeing the root of the world,\nYou complete harmony\nAnd become as unshaped wood.\nUsing the light, being dark,\nBeing the world,\nYou perfect harmony\nAnd return to the Way.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Ambition\n\nThose who wish to change the world\nAccording with their desire\nCannot succeed.\nThe world is shaped by the Way;\nIt cannot be shaped by the self.\nTrying to change it, you damage it;\nTrying to possess it, you lose it.\nSo some will lead, while others follow.\nSome will be warm, others cold\nSome will be strong, others weak.\nSome will get where they are going\nWhile others fall by the side of the road.\nSo the sage will be neither extravagant nor violent.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Violence\n\nPowerful men are well advised not to use violence,\nFor violence has a habit of returning;\nThorns and weeds grow wherever an army goes,\nAnd lean years follow a great war.\nA general is well advised\nTo achieve nothing more than his orders:\nNot to take advantage of his victory.\nNor to glory, boast or pride himself;\nTo do what is dictated by necessity,\nNot by choice.\nFor even the strongest force will weaken with time,\nAnd then its violence will return, and kill it.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Armies\n\nArmies are tools of violence;\nThey cause men to hate and fear.\nThe sage will not join them.\nHis purpose is creation;\nTheir purpose is destruction.\nWeapons are tools of violence,\nNot of the sage;\nHe uses them only when there is no choice,\nAnd then calmly, and with tact,\nFor he finds no beauty in them.\nWhoever finds beauty in weapons\nDelights in the slaughter of men;\nAnd who delights in slaughter\nCannot content himself with peace.\nSo slaughters must be mourned\nAnd conquest celebrated with a funeral.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Shapes\n\nThe Way has no true shape,\nAnd therefore none can control it.\nIf a ruler could control the Way\nAll things would follow\nIn harmony with his desire,\nAnd sweet rain would fall,\nEffortlessly slaking every thirst.\nThe Way is shaped by use,\nBut then the shape is lost.\nDo not hold fast to shapes\nBut let sensation flow into the world\nAs a river courses down to the sea.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Virtues\n\nWho understands the world is learned;\nWho understands the self is enlightened.\nWho conquers the world has strength;\nWho conquers the self has harmony;\nWho is determined has purpose.\nWho is contented has wealth;\nWho defends his home may long endure;\nWho surrenders his home may long survive it.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Control\n\nThe Way flows and ebbs, creating and destroying,\nImplementing all the world, attending to the tiniest details,\nClaiming nothing in return.\nIt nurtures all things,\nThough it does not control them;\nIt has no intention,\nSo it seems inconsequential.\nIt is the substance of all things;\nThough it does not control them;\nIt has no exception,\nSo it seems all-important.\nThe sage would not control the world;\nHe is in harmony with the world.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Peace\n\nIf you offer music and food\nStrangers may stop with you;\nBut if you accord with the Way\nAll the people of the world will keep you\nIn safety, health, community, and peace.\nThe Way lacks art and flavour;\nIt can neither be seen nor heard,\nBut its benefit cannot be exhausted.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Opposition\n\nTo reduce someone's influence, first expand it;\nTo reduce someone's force, first increase it;\nTo overthrow someone, first exalt them;\nTo take from someone, first give to them.\nThis is the subtlety by which the weak overcome the strong:\nFish should not leave their depths,\nAnd swords should not leave their scabbards.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Tranquillity\n\nThe Way takes no action, but leaves nothing undone.\nWhen you accept this\nThe world will flourish,\nIn harmony with nature.\nNature does not possess desire;\nWithout desire, the heart becomes quiet;\nIn this manner the whole world is made tranquil.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Ritual\n\nWell established hierarchies are not easily uprooted;\nClosely held beliefs are not easily released;\nSo ritual enthralls generation after generation.\nHarmony does not care for harmony, and so is naturally attained;\nBut ritual is intent upon harmony, and so can not attain it.\nHarmony neither acts nor reasons;\nLove acts, but without reason;\nJustice acts to serve reason;\nBut ritual acts to enforce reason.\nWhen the Way is lost, there remains harmony;\nWhen harmony is lost, there remains love;\nWhen love is lost, there remains justice;\nAnd when justice is lost, there remains ritual.\nRitual is the end of compassion and honesty,\nThe beginning of confusion;\nBelief is a colourful hope or fear,\nThe beginning of folly.\nThe sage goes by harmony, not by hope;\nHe dwells in the fruit, not the flower;\nHe accepts substance, and ignores abstraction.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Support\n\nIn mythical times all things were whole:\nAll the sky was clear,\nAll the earth was stable,\nAll the mountains were firm,\nAll the riverbeds were full,\nAll of nature was fertile,\nAnd all the rulers were supported.\nBut, losing clarity, the sky tore;\nLosing stability, the earth split;\nLosing strength, the mountains sank;\nLosing water, the riverbeds cracked;\nLosing fertility, nature disappeared;\nAnd losing support, the rulers fell.\nRulers depend upon their subjects,\nThe noble depend upon the humble;\nSo rulers call themselves orphaned, hungry and alone,\nTo win the people's support.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Motion and Use\n\nThe motion of the Way is to return;\nThe use of the Way is to accept;\nAll things come from the Way,\nAnd the Way comes from nothing.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Following\n\nWhen the great man learns the Way, he follows it with diligence;\nWhen the common man learns the Way, he follows it on occasion;\nWhen the mean man learns the Way, he laughs out loud;\nThose who do not laugh, do not learn at all.\nTherefore it is said:\nWho understands the Way seems foolish;\nWho progresses on the Way seems to fail;\nWho follows the Way seems to wander.\nFor the finest harmony appears plain;\nThe brightest truth appears coloured;\nThe richest character appears incomplete;\nThe bravest heart appears meek;\nThe simplest nature appears inconstant.\nThe square, perfected, has no corner;\nMusic, perfected, has no melody;\nLove, perfected, has no climax;\nArt, perfected, has no meaning.\nThe Way can be neither sensed nor known:\nIt transmits sensation and transcends knowledge.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Mind\n\nThe Way bears sensation,\nSensation bears memory,\nSensation and memory bear abstraction,\nAnd abstraction bears all the world;\nEach thing in the world bears feeling and doing,\nAnd, imbued with mind, harmony with the Way.\nAs others have taught, so do I teach,\n\"Who loses harmony opposes nature\";\nThis is the root of my teaching.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Overcoming\n\nWater overcomes the stone;\nWithout substance it requires no opening;\nThis is the benefit of taking no action.\nYet benefit without action,\nAnd experience without abstraction,\nAre practiced by very few.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Contentment\n\nHealth or reputation: which is held dearer?\nHealth or possessions: which has more worth?\nProfit or loss: which is more troublesome?\nGreat love incurs great expense,\nAnd great wealth incurs great fear,\nBut contentment comes at no cost.\nFor who knows when to stop\nDoes not continue into danger,\nAnd so may long endure.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Quiet\n\nGreat perfection seems incomplete,\nBut does not decay;\nGreat abundance seems empty,\nBut does not fail.\nGreat truth seems contradictory;\nGreat cleverness seems stupid;\nGreat eloquence seems awkward.\nAs spring overcomes the cold,\nAnd autumn overcomes the heat,\nSo calm and quiet overcome the world.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Horses\n\nWhen a nation follows the Way,\nHorses bear manure through its fields;\nWhen a nation ignores the Way,\nHorses bear soldiers through its streets.\nThere is no greater mistake than following desire;\nThere is no greater disaster than forgetting contentment;\nThere is no greater sickness than seeking attainment;\nBut one who is content to satisfy his needs\nFinds that contentment endures.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Knowing\n\nWithout taking a step outdoors\nYou know the whole world;\nWithout taking a peep out the window\nYou know the colour of the sky.\nThe more you experience,\nThe less you know.\nThe sage wanders without knowing,\nLooks without seeing,\nAccomplishes without acting.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Inaction\n\nThe follower of knowledge learns as much as he can every day;\nThe follower of the Way forgets as much as he can every day.\nBy attrition he reaches a state of inaction\nWherein he does nothing, but nothing remains undone.\nTo conquer the world, accomplish nothing;\nIf you must accomplish something,\nThe world remains beyond conquest.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","People\n\nThe sage does not distinguish between himself and the world;\nThe needs of other people are as his own.\nHe is good to those who are good;\nHe is also good to those who are not good,\nThereby he is good.\nHe trusts those who are trustworthy;\nHe also trusts those who are not trustworthy,\nThereby he is trustworthy.\nThe sage lives in harmony with the world,\nAnd his mind is the world's mind.\nSo he nurtures the worlds of others\nAs a mother does her children.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Death\n\nMen flow into life, and ebb into death.\nSome are filled with life;\nSome are empty with death;\nSome hold fast to life, and thereby perish,\nFor life is an abstraction.\nThose who are filled with life\nNeed not fear tigers and rhinos in the wilds,\nNor wear armour and shields in battle;\nThe rhinoceros finds no place in them for its horn,\nThe tiger no place for its claw,\nThe soldier no place for a weapon,\nFor death finds no place in them.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Nurture\n\nThe Way bears all things;\nHarmony nurtures them;\nNature shapes them;\nUse completes them.\nEach follows the Way and honours harmony,\nNot by law,\nBut by being.\nThe Way bears, nurtures, shapes, completes,\nShelters, comforts, and makes a home for them.\nBearing without possessing,\nNurturing without taming,\nShaping without forcing,\nThis is harmony.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Clarity\n\nThe origin of the world is its mother;\nUnderstand the mother, and you understand the child;\nEmbrace the child, and you embrace the mother,\nWho will not perish when you die.\nReserve your judgments and words\nAnd you maintain your influence;\nSpeak your mind and take positions\nAnd nothing will save you.\nAs observing detail is clarity,\nSo maintaining flexibility is strength;\nUse the light but shed no light,\nSo that you do yourself no harm,\nBut embrace clarity.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Difficult Paths\n\nWith but a small understanding\nOne may follow the Way like a main road,\nFearing only to leave it;\nFollowing a main road is easy,\nYet people delight in difficult paths.\nWhen palaces are kept up\nFields are left to weeds\nAnd granaries empty;\nWearing fine clothes,\nBearing sharp swords,\nGlutting with food and drink,\nHoarding wealth and possessions -\nThese are the ways of theft,\nAnd far from the Way.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Cultivate Harmony\n\nCultivate harmony within yourself, and harmony becomes real;\nCultivate harmony within your family, and harmony becomes fertile;\nCultivate harmony within your community, and harmony becomes\nabundant;\nCultivate harmony within your culture, and harmony becomes\nenduring;\nCultivate harmony within the world, and harmony becomes ubiquitous.\nLive with a person to understand that person;\nLive with a family to understand that family;\nLive with a community to understand that community;\nLive with a culture to understand that culture;\nLive with the world to understand the world.\nHow can I live with the world?\nBy accepting.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Soft Bones\n\nWho is filled with harmony is like a newborn.\nWasps and snakes will not bite him;\nHawks and tigers will not claw him.\nHis bones are soft yet his grasp is sure,\nFor his flesh is supple;\nHis mind is innocent yet his body is virile,\nFor his vigour is plentiful;\nHis song is long-lasting yet his voice is sweet,\nFor his grace is perfect.\nBut knowing harmony creates abstraction,\nAnd following abstraction creates ritual.\nExceeding nature creates calamity,\nAnd controlling nature creates violence.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Impartiality\n\nWho understands does not preach;\nWho preaches does not understand.\nReserve your judgments and words;\nSmooth differences and forgive disagreements;\nDull your wit and simplify your purpose;\nAccept the world.\nThen,\nFriendship and enmity,\nProfit and loss,\nHonour and disgrace,\nWill not affect you;\nThe world will accept you.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Conquer with Inaction\n\nDo not control the people with laws,\nNor violence nor espionage,\nBut conquer them with inaction.\nFor:\nThe more morals and taboos there are,\nThe more cruelty afflicts people;\nThe more guns and knives there are,\nThe more factions divide people;\nThe more arts and skills there are,\nThe more change obsoletes people;\nThe more laws and taxes there are,\nThe more theft corrupts people.\nYet take no action, and the people nurture eachother;\nMake no laws, and the people deal fairly with eachother;\nOwn no interest, and the people cooperate with eachother;\nExpress no desire, and the people harmonize with eachother.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","No End\n\nWhen government is lazy and informal\nThe people are kind and honest;\nWhen government is efficient and severe\nThe people are discontented and deceitful.\nGood fortune follows upon disaster;\nDisaster lurks within good fortune;\nWho can say how things will end?\nPerhaps there is no end.\nHonesty is ever deceived;\nKindness is ever seduced;\nMen have been like this for a long time.\nSo the sage is firm but not cutting,\nPointed but not piercing,\nStraight but not rigid,\nBright but not blinding.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Restraint\n\nManage a great nation as you would cook a delicate fish.\nTo govern men in accord with nature\nIt is best to be restrained;\nRestraint makes agreement easy to attain,\nAnd easy agreement builds harmonious relationships;\nWith sufficient harmony no resistance will arise;\nWhen no resistance arises, then you possess the heart of the\nnation,\nAnd when you possess the nation's heart, your influence will long\nendure:\nDeeply rooted and firmly established.\nThis is the method of far sight and long life.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Demons\n\nWhen you use the Way to conquer the world,\nYour demons will lose their power to harm.\nIt is not that they lose their power as such,\nBut that they will not harm others;\nBecause they will not harm others,\nYou will not harm others:\nWhen neither you nor your demons can do harm,\nYou will be at peace with them.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Submission\n\nA nation is like a hierarchy, a marketplace, and a maiden.\nA maiden wins her husband by submitting to his advances;\nSubmission is a means of union.\nSo when a large country submits to a small country\nIt will adopt the small country;\nWhen a small country submits to a large country\nIt will be adopted by the large country;\nThe one submits and adopts;\nThe other submits and is adopted.\nIt is in the interest of a large country to unite and gain service,\nAnd in the interest of a small country to unite and gain patronage;\nIf both would serve their interests,\nBoth must submit.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Sin\n\nThe Way is the fate of men,\nThe treasure of the saint,\nAnd the refuge of the sinner.\nFine words are often borrowed,\nAnd great deeds are often appropriated;\nTherefore, when a man falls, do not abandon him,\nAnd when a man gains power, do not honour him;\nOnly remain impartial and show him the Way.\nWhy should someone appreciate the Way?\nThe ancients said, \"By it, those who seek may easily find,\nAnd those who regret may easily absolve\"\nSo it is the most precious gift.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Difficulty\n\nPractice no-action;\nAttend to do-nothing;\nTaste the flavorless,\nMagnify the small,\nMultiply the few,\nReturn love for hate.\nDeal with the difficult while it is yet easy;\nDeal with the great while it is yet small;\nThe difficult develops naturally from the easy,\nAnd the great from the small;\nSo the sage, by dealing with the small,\nAchieves the great.\nWho finds it easy to promise finds it hard to be trusted;\nWho takes things lightly finds things difficult;\nThe sage recognizes difficulty, and so has none.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Care at the Beginning\n\nWhat lies still is easy to grasp;\nWhat lies far off is easy to anticipate;\nWhat is brittle is easy to shatter;\nWhat is small is easy to disperse.\nYet a tree broader than a man can embrace is born of a tiny shoot;\nA dam greater than a river can overflow starts with a clod of\nearth;\nA journey of a thousand miles begins at the spot under one's feet.\nTherefore deal with things before they happen;\nCreate order before there is confusion.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Care at the End\n\nHe who acts, spoils;\nHe who grasps, loses.\nPeople often fail on the verge of success;\nTake care at the end as at the beginning,\nSo that you may avoid failure.\nThe sage desires no-desire,\nValues no-value,\nLearns no-learning,\nAnd returns to the places that people have forgotten;\nHe would help all people to become natural,\nBut then he would not be natural.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Subtlety\n\nThe ancients did not seek to rule people with knowledge,\nBut to help them become natural.\nIt is difficult for knowledgeable people to become natural.\nTo use law to control a nation weakens the nation.\nBut to use nature to control a nation strengthens the nation.\nUnderstanding these two paths is understanding subtlety;\nSubtlety runs deep, ranges wide,\nResolves confusion and preserves peace.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Lead by Following\n\nThe river carves out the valley by flowing beneath it.\nThereby the river is the master of the valley.\nIn order to master people\nOne must speak as their servant;\nIn order to lead people\nOne must follow them.\nSo when the sage rises above the people,\nThey do not feel oppressed;\nAnd when the sage stands before the people,\nThey do not feel hindered.\nSo the popularity of the sage does not fail,\nHe does not contend, and no one contends against him.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Unimportance\n\nAll the world says,\n\"I am important;\nI am separate from all the world.\nI am important because I am separate,\nWere I the same, I could never be important.\"\nYet here are three treasures\nThat I cherish and commend to you:\nThe first is compassion,\nBy which one finds courage.\nThe second is restraint,\nBy which one finds strength.\nAnd the third is unimportance,\nBy which one finds influence.\nThose who are fearless, but without compassion,\nPowerful, but without restraint,\nOr influential, yet important,\nCannot endure.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Compassion\n\nCompassion is the finest weapon and best defence.\nIf you would establish harmony,\nCompassion must surround you like a fortress.\nTherefore,\nA good soldier does not inspire fear;\nA good fighter does not display aggression;\nA good conqueror does not engage in battle;\nA good leader does not exercise authority.\nThis is the value of unimportance;\nThis is how to win the cooperation of others;\nThis to how to build the same harmony that is in nature.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Ambush\n\nThere is a saying among soldiers:\nIt is easier to lose a yard than take an inch.\nIn this manner one may deploy troops without marshalling them,\nBring weapons to bear without exposing them,\nEngage the foe without invading them,\nAnd exhaust their strength without fighting them.\nThere is no worse disaster than misunderstanding your enemy;\nTo do so endangers all of my treasures;\nSo when two well matched forces oppose eachother,\nThe general who maintains compassion will win.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Individuality\n\nMy words are easy to understand\nAnd my actions are easy to perform\nYet no other can understand or perform them.\nMy words have meaning; my actions have reason;\nYet these cannot be known and I cannot be known.\nWe are each unique, and therefore valuable;\nThough the sage wears coarse clothes, his heart is jade.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Limitation\n\nWho recognizes his limitations is healthy;\nWho ignores his limitations is sick.\nThe sage recognizes this sickness as a limitation.\nAnd so becomes immune.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Revolution\n\nWhen people have nothing more to lose,\nThen revolution will result.\nDo not take away their lands,\nAnd do not destroy their livelihoods;\nIf your burden is not heavy then they will not shirk it.\nThe sage maintains himself but exacts no tribute,\nValues himself but requires no honours;\nHe ignores abstraction and accepts substance.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Fate\n\nWho is brave and bold will perish;\nWho is brave and subtle will benefit.\nThe subtle profit where the bold perish\nFor Fate does not honour daring.\nAnd even the sage dares not tempt fate.\nFate does not attack, yet all things are conquered by it;\nIt does not ask, yet all things answer to it;\nIt does not call, yet all things meet it;\nIt does not plan, yet all things are determined by it.\nFate's net is vast and its mesh is coarse,\nYet none escape it.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Execution\n\nIf people were not afraid of death,\nThen what would be the use of an executioner?\nIf people were only afraid of death,\nAnd you executed everyone who did not obey,\nNo one would dare to disobey you.\nThen what would be the use of an executioner?\nPeople fear death because death is an instrument of fate.\nWhen people are killed by execution rather than by fate,\nThis is like carving wood in the place of a carpenter.\nThose who

regard for their own lives\nThey overcome those who value only their own lives.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Flexibility\n\nA newborn is soft and tender,\nA crone, hard and stiff.\nPlants and animals, in life, are supple and succulent;\nIn death, withered and dry.\nSo softness and tenderness are attributes of life,\nAnd hardness and stiffness, attributes of death.\nJust as a sapless tree

broadened;\nNature's motion decreases those who have more than they need\nAnd increases those who need more than they have.\nIt is not so with Man.\nMan decreases those who need more than they have\nAnd increases those who have more than they need.\nTo give away what you do not need is to follow the Way.\nSo the sage gives without expectation,\nAccomplishes without claiming credit,\nAnd has no desire for ostentation.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Yielding\n\nNothing in the world is as soft and yielding as water,\nYet nothing can better overcome the hard and strong,\nFor they can neither control nor do away with it.\nThe soft overcomes the hard,\nThe yielding overcomes the strong;\nEvery person knows this,\nBut no one can practice it.\nWho attends to the people would control the land and grain;\nWho attends to the state would control the whole world;\nTruth is easily hidden by rhetoric.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Reconciliation\n\nWhen conflict is reconciled, some hard feelings remain;\nThis is dangerous.\nThe sage accepts less than is due\nAnd does not blame or punish;\nFor harmony seeks agreement\nWhere justice seeks payment.\nThe ancients said: \"nature is impartial;\nTherefore it serves those who serve all.\"\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","Utopia\n\nLet your community be small, with only a few people;\nKeep tools in abundance, but do not depend

well and make beautiful things.\nLive peacefully and delight in your own society;\nDwell within cock-crow of your neighbours,\nBut maintain your independence from them.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","The Sage\n\nHonest people use no rhetoric;\nRhetoric is not honesty.\nEnlightened people are not cultured;\nCulture is not enlightenment.\nContent people are not wealthy;\nWealth is not contentment.\nSo the sage does not serve himself;\nThe more he does for others, the more he is satisfied;\nThe more he gives, the more he receives.\nNature flourishes at the expense of no one;\nSo the sage benefits all men and contends with none.\n\t\t-- Lao Tse, \"Tao Te Ching\"","A fellow bought a new car, a Nissan, and was quite happy with his purchase.\nHe was something of an animist, however,
