At Harvard<br/>one August night in 1945, Hopper and her associates were working on the<br/>\"granddaddy\" of modern computers, the Mark I.  \"Things were going badly;<br/>there was something wrong in one of the circuits of the long glass-enclosed<br/>computer,\" she said.  \"Finally, someone located the trouble spot and, using<br/>ordinary tweezers, removed the problem, a two-inch moth.  From then on, when<br/>anything went wrong with a computer, we said it had bugs in it.\"  Hopper<br/>said that when the veracity of her story was questioned recently, \"I referred<br/>them to my 1945 log book, now in the collection of the Naval Surface Weapons<br/>Center, and they found the remains of that moth taped to the page in<br/>question.\"<br/>\t\t[actually, the term \"bug\" had even earlier usage in<br/>\t\tregard to problems with radio hardware.  Ed.]","\"Every group has a couple of experts.  And every group has at least one<br/>idiot.  Thus are balance and harmony (and discord) maintained.

The salient characteristic of an imbedded system is that<br/>it cannot be allowed to get into a state from which only direct intervention<br/>will suffice to remove it.  An imbedded system can't permanently trust anything<br/>it hears from the outside world.  It must sniff around, adapt, consider, sniff<br/>around, and adapt again.  I'm not talking about ordinary modular programming<br/>carefulness here.  No.  Programming an imbedded system calls for undiluted<br/>raging maniacal paranoia.  For example, our ethernet front ends need to know<br/>what network number they are on so that they can address and route PUPs<br/>properly.  How do you find out what your network number is?  Easy, you ask a<br/>gateway.  Gateways are required by definition to know their correct network<br/>numbers.  Once you've got your network number, you start using it and before<br/>you can blink you've got it wired into fifteen different sockets spread all<br/>over creation.  Now what happens when the panic-stricken operator realizes he<br/>was running the wrong version of the gateway which was giving out the wrong<br/>network number?  Never supposed to happen.  Tough.

Since<br/>she was certain that he would forget that they had moved and where they had<br/>moved to, she wrote down the new address on a piece of paper, and gave it to<br/>him.  Naturally, in the course of the day, an insight occurred to him.  He<br/>reached in his pocket, found a piece of paper on which he furiously scribbled<br/>some notes, thought it over, decided there was a fallacy in his idea, and<br/>threw the piece of paper away.  At the end of the day he went home (to the<br/>old address in Cambridge, of course).  When he got there he realized that they<br/>had moved, that he had no idea where they had moved to, and that the piece of<br/>paper with the address was long gone.  Fortunately inspiration struck.  There<br/>was a young girl on the street and he conceived the idea of asking her where<br/>he had moved to, saying, \"Excuse me, perhaps you know me.  I'm Norbert Weiner<br/>and we've just moved.  Would you know where we've moved to?\"  To which the<br/>young girl replied, \"Yes, Daddy, Mommy thought you would forget.\"<br/>\tThe capper to the story is that I asked his daughter (the girl in the<br/>story) about the truth of the story, many years later.

The problem<br/>of frog computability has become a critical issue that ranges across all areas<br/>of computer science.  It has been shown that anything computable by an amphi-<br/>bian community in a fixed-size pond is computable by a frog in the same-size<br/>pond -- that is to say, frogs are Pond-space complete.  We will show that<br/>there is a log-space, polywog-time reduction from any Turing machine program<br/>to a frog.

As a test of our ideas, we have written IMMANUEL, a<br/>wisdom based system for the task domain of western philosophical thought.<br/>IMMANUEL was supplied initially with 200 wisdom units which contained wisdom<br/>about such elementary concepts as mind, matter, being, nothingness, and so<br/>forth.  IMMANUEL was then allowed to run freely, guided by the heuristic<br/>rules contained in its heterarchically organized meta wisdom base.  IMMANUEL<br/>succeeded in rediscovering most of the important philosophical ideas developed<br/>in western culture over the course of the last 25 centuries, including those<br/>underlying Plato's theory of government, Kant's metaphysics, Nietzsche's theory<br/>of value, and Husserl's phenomenology.  In this seminar, we will describe<br/>IMMANUEL's achievements and internal architecture.  We will also briefly<br/>discuss our recent efforts to apply wisdom engineering to oil exploration.","Staff meeting in the conference room in %d minutes.","Staff meeting in the conference room in 3 minutes.","Standards are crucial.

The data types range from CC, OUNCE, SHOT, and<br/>JIGGER to FIFTH (hence the name of the language), LITER, MAGNUM and<br/>BLOTTO.  Commands refer to ingredients such as CHABLIS, CHARDONNAY,<br/>CABERNET, GIN, VERMOUTH, VODKA, SCOTCH, and WHATEVERSAROUND.<br/><br/>The many versions of the FIFTH language reflect the sophistication and<br/>financial status of its users.

For him neither the rule of<br/>human nor the rule of divine will exists as an independent cause of natural<br/>events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a personal God interfering with natural<br/>events could never be refuted, in the real sense, by science, for this<br/>doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific knowledge<br/>has not yet been able to set foot.<br/><br/>But I am persuaded that such behavior on the part of the representatives<br/>of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine which<br/>is able to maintain itself not in clear light, but only in the dark, will<br/>of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm to human<br/>progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers of religion<br/>must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God, that is,<br/>give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vast<br/>powers in the hands of priests.  In their labors they will have to avail<br/>themselves of those forces which are capable of cultivating the Good, the<br/>True, and the Beautiful in humanity itself.

No matter how assured<br/>we may be about certain aspects of our belief, there are always painful<br/>inconsistencies, exceptions, and contradictions.  This is true in religion as<br/>it is in politics, and is self-evident to all except fanatics and the naive.<br/>As for the fanatics, whose number is legion in our own time, we might be<br/>advised to leave them to heaven.  They will not, unfortunately, do us the<br/>same courtesy.  They attack us and each other, and whatever their<br/>protestations to peaceful intent, the bloody record of history makes clear<br/>that they are easily disposed to restore to the sword.  My own belief in<br/>God, then, is just that -- a matter of belief, not knowledge.  My respect<br/>for Jesus Christ arises from the fact that He seems to have been the<br/>most virtuous inhabitant of Planet Earth.  But even well-educated Christians<br/>are frustrated in their thirst for certainty about the beloved figure<br/>of Jesus because of the undeniable ambiguity of the scriptural record.<br/>Such ambiguity is not apparent to children or fanatics, but every<br/>recognized Bible scholar is perfectly aware of it.

Brian now realizes this and<br/>has, after eleven years, left the sect he was associated with.  The<br/>problem is that once the untrained mind has made a formal commitment to<br/>a religious philosophy -- and it does not matter whether that philosophy<br/>is generally reasonable and high-minded or utterly bizarre and<br/>irrational -- the powers of reason are surprisingly ineffective in<br/>changing the believer's mind.<br/>- Steve Allen, comedian, from an essay in the book \"The Courage of<br/>  Conviction\", edited by Philip Berman","Nothing is easier than to denounce the evildoer; nothing is more difficult<br/>than to understand him.<br/>\t\t-- Fyodor Dostoevski","We may not be able to persuade Hindus that Jesus and not Vishnu should<br/>govern their spiritual horizon, nor Moslems that Lord Buddha is at the<br/>center of their spiritual universe, nor Hebrews that Mohammed is a major<br/>prophet, nor Christians that Shinto best expresses their spiritual<br/>concerns, to say nothing of the fact that we may not be able to get<br/>Christians to agree among themselves about their relationship to God.<br/>But all will agree on a proposition that they possess profound spiritual<br/>resources.  If, in addition, we can get them to accept the further<br/>proposition that whatever form the Deity may have in their own theology,<br/>the Deity is not only external, but internal and acts through them, and<br/>they themselves give proof or disproof of the Deity in what they do and<br/>think; if this further proposition can be accepted, then we come that<br/>much closer to a truly religious situation on earth.<br/>\t\t-- Norman Cousins, from his book \"Human Options\"","The Messiah will come.

It is the essence of all dogmatic faiths to hold that<br/>any such \"show-down\" is sacrilegious and perverse.

The \"religious\"<br/>would be the last to be willing that either the history of the<br/>content of religion should be taught in this spirit; while those<br/>to whom the scientific standpoint is not merely a technical device,<br/>but is the embodiment of the integrity of mind, must protest against<br/>its being taught in any other spirit.<br/>- John Dewey (1859-1953), American philosopher,<br/>  from \"Democracy in the Schools\", 1908","In the broad and final sense all institutions are educational in the<br/>sense that they operate to form the attitudes, dispositions, abilities<br/>and disabilities that constitute a concrete personality...Whether this<br/>educative process is carried on in a predominantly democratic or non-<br/>democratic way becomes, therefore, a question of transcendent importance<br/>not only for education itself but for its final effect upon all the<br/>interests and activities of a society that is committed to the democratic<br/>way of life.<br/>\t\t-- John Dewey (1859-1953), American philosopher","History shows that the human mind, fed by constant accessions of knowledge,<br/>periodically grows too large for its theoretical coverings, and bursts<br/>them asunder to appear in new habiliments, as the feeding and growing<br/>grub, at intervals, casts its too narrow skin and assumes another...<br/>Truly the imago state of Man seems to be terribly distant, but every<br/>moult is a step gained.<br/>\t\t-- Charles Darwin, from \"Origin of the Species\"","...I would go so far as to suggest that, were it not for our ego and<br/>concern to be different, the African apes would be included in our<br/>family, the Hominidae.<br/>\t\t-- Richard Leakey","It is inconceivable that a judicious observer from another solar system<br/>would see in our species -- which has tended to be cruel, destructive,<br/>wasteful, and irrational -- the crown and apex of cosmic evolution.<br/>Viewing us as the culmination of *anything* is grotesque; viewing us<br/>as a transitional species makes more sense -- and gives us more hope.<br/>- Betty McCollister, \"Our Transitional Species\",<br/>  Free Inquiry magazine, Vol. 8, No. 1","\"Well, you see, it's such a transitional creature.

What stifled my laughter<br/>is that the image fits.  Reagan has always exhibited a fey indifference toward<br/>science.  Facts, like numbers, roll off his back.  And we've all come to<br/>accept it.  This time it was stargazing that became a serious issue....Not<br/>that long ago, it was Reagan's support of Creationism....Creationists actually<br/>got equal time with evolutionists.  The public was supposed to be open-minded<br/>to the claims of paleontologists and fundamentalists, as if the two were<br/>scientific colleagues....It has been clear for a long time that the president<br/>is averse to science...In general, these attitudes fall onto friendly American<br/>turf....But at the outer edges, this skepticism about science easily turns<br/>into a kind of naive acceptance of nonscience, or even nonsense.  The same<br/>people who doubt experts can also believe any quackery, from the benefits of<br/>laetrile to eye of newt to the movement of planets.

Greenberg, Editor, _Science and Government Report_, writing in<br/>   \"Newsday\", May 5, 1988","[Astrology is] 100 percent hokum, Ted.  As a matter of fact, the first edition<br/>of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, written in 1771 -- 1771! -- said that this<br/>belief system is a subject long ago ridiculed and reviled.  We're dealing with<br/>beliefs that go back to the ancient Babylonians.  There's nothing there....<br/>It sounds a lot like science, it sounds like astronomy.  It's got technical<br/>terms.  It's got jargon.  It confuses the public....The astrologer is quite<br/>glib, confuses the public, uses terms which come from science, come from<br/>metaphysics, come from a host of fields, but they really mean nothing.  The<br/>fact is that astrological beliefs go back at least 2,500 years.  Now that<br/>should be a sufficiently long time for astrologers to prove their case.  They<br/>have not proved their case....It's just simply gibberish.  The fact is, there's<br/>no theory for it, there are no observational data for it.  It's been tested<br/>and tested over the centuries.  Nobody's ever found any validity to it at<br/>all.  It is not even close to a science.  A science has to be repeatable, it<br/>has to have a logical foundation, and it has to be potentially vulnerable --<br/>you test it.

What force or influence,<br/>what sort of energy would travel from the planets and stars to all human<br/>beings and affect our development or fate?  No amount of scientific-sounding<br/>jargon or computerized calculations by astrologers can disguise this central<br/>problem with astrology -- we can find no evidence of a mechanism by which<br/>celestial objects can influence us in so specific and personal a way. . . .<br/>Some astrologers argue that there may be a still unknown force that represents<br/>the astrological influence. . . .If so, astrological predictions -- like those<br/>of any scientific field -- should be easily tested. . . . Astrologers always<br/>claim to be just a little too busy to carry out such careful tests of their<br/>efficacy, so in the last two decades scientists and statisticians have<br/>generously done such testing for them.  There have been dozens of well-designed<br/>tests all around the world, and astrology has failed every one of them. . . .<br/>I propose that we let those beckoning lights in the sky awaken our interest<br/>in the real (and fascinating) universe beyond our planet, and not let them<br/>keep us tied to an ancient fantasy left over from a time when we huddled by<br/>the firelight, afraid of the night.<br/>-- Andrew Fraknoi, Executive Officer, Astronomical Society of the Pacific,<br/>    \"Why Astrology Believers Should Feel Embarrassed,\" San Jose Mercury<br/>    News, May 8, 1988","With the news that Nancy Reagan has referred to an astrologer when planning<br/>her husband's schedule, and reports of Californians evacuating Los Angeles<br/>on the strength of a prediction from a sixteenth-century physician and<br/>astrologer Michel de Notredame, the image of the U.S. as a scientific and<br/>technological nation has taking a bit of a battering lately.  Sadly, such<br/>happenings cannot be dismissed as passing fancies.  They are manifestations<br/>of a well-established \"anti-science\" tendency in the U.S. which, ultimately,<br/>could threaten the country's position as a technological power. . . .  The<br/>manifest widespread desire to reject rationality and substitute a series<br/>of quasirandom beliefs in order to understand the universe does not augur<br/>well for a nation deeply concerned about its ability to compete with its<br/>industrial equals.  To the degree that it reflects the thinking of a<br/>significant section of the public, this point of view encourages ignorance<br/>of and, indeed, contempt for science and for rational methods of approaching<br/>truth. . . .

If you *do* understand<br/>the memo in question, but have absolutely nothing of substance to say, then<br/>you have an excellent opportunity for a vicious ad hominem attack.  In fact,<br/>the only *inappropriate* times for an ad hominem attack are as follows:<br/><br/>\t1: When you agree completely with the author of an memo.<br/>\t2: When the author of the original memo is much bigger than you are.<br/>\t3: When replying to one of your own memos.","Fourth Law of Applied Terror:<br/>\tThe night before the English History mid-term, your Biology<br/>\tinstructor will assign 200 pages on planaria.<br/><br/>Corollary:<br/>\tEvery instructor assumes that you have nothing else to do except<br/>\tstudy for that instructor's course.","Fourth Law of Revision:<br/>\tIt is usually impractical to worry beforehand about<br/>\tinterferences -- if you have none, someone will make one for you.","Fourth Law of Thermodynamics:<br/>\tIf the probability of success is not almost one, it is damn near zero.<br/>\t\t-- David Ellis","Fresco's Discovery:<br/>\tIf you knew what you were doing you'd probably be bored.","Fried's 1st Rule:<br/>\tIncreased automation of clerical function<br/>\tinvariably results in increased operational costs.","Friends, n.:<br/>\tPeople who borrow your books and set wet glasses on them.<br/><br/>\tPeople who know you well, but like you anyway.","Frobnicate, v.:<br/>\tTo manipulate or adjust, to tweak.

We do a range of matching accessories,<br/>including -- if I may say so -- a rather saucy garter holster.  Wish I<br/>got to do the fitting for that!  Ha -- just my little joke.  And<br/>there's *even*... here we are -- this special presentation pack: gun,<br/>charged battery, charging unit, beautiful glider-hide shoulder holster<br/>with adjustable fitting and contrast stitching, and a discount on your<br/>next battery.  Full instructions, of course, and a voucher for free<br/>lessons at your local gun club or range.  Or there's the *special*<br/>presentation pack; it has all the other one's got but with *two*<br/>charged batteries and a night-sight, too.  Here, feel that -- don't<br/>worry, it's a dummy battery -- isn't it neat?  Feel how light it is?<br/>Smooth, see?  No bits to stick out and catch on your clothes, *and*<br/>beautifully balanced.  And of course the beauty of a laser is, there's<br/>no recoil.  Because it's shooting light, you see?  Beautiful gun,<br/>beautiful gun; my wife has one.  Really.  That's not a line, she<br/>really has.  Now, I can do you that one -- with a battery and a free<br/>charge -- for ninety-five; or the presentation pack on a special<br/>offer for one-nineteen; or this, the special presentation pack, for<br/>one-forty-nine.\"<br/><br/>\"I'll take the special.\"<br/><br/>\"Sound choice, madam, *sound* choice.
